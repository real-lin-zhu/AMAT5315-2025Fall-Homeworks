**Note:** Submit your solutions in either `.md` (Markdown) or `.jl` (Julia) format.

1. **(Computational Complexity)** Reduce the following circuit SAT (half adder) to a spin glass ground state problem.

2. **(Spin Dynamics)** Use the spin dynamics simulation to find the ground state of the above spin glass problem. Fix the output is $S=0, C=1$, and read out the input spin configuration.

3. **(Greedy Algorithm)** Implement the greedy algorithm for solving the maximum independent set problem. Generate random 3-regular graphs at different sizes (e.g. $n=10, 20, 30, 40, 50,...,200$), and show the scaling of approximation ratio. Can this algorithm maintain the same approximation ratio?
